The **4th dimension** can **push/pull cubes together** and will crush you from time to time.\r\n* some sides of some cubes can trigger **special actions** like rotate cubes, destroy a cube, mirror cubes on an axis\r\n* collect as many **golden mini cubes** as you can to **buy new special cubes with special powers**\r\n* **special cubes** (like the **companion cube**, classic **mario cube**, a typical **minecraft cube**) with special powers  \r\n\r\n### Links\r\n[play the game now](http://wproglk.github.com/4thDimensionGame/play)\r\n[GitHub page of 4thDimensionGame](http://wproglk.github.com/4thDimensionGame)\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\nCollect as many golden mini cubes as you can during the game. You can buy special cubes with special powers with this mini cubes during the game, but is it worth it? It's up to you! Maybe you can use a special cube for your own advantage to get even more mini golden cubes or to block, prevent or harm an opponent!\r\n\r\n### Rules\r\nThe 4th dimension game is a 3D board game for 2 to 4 players. First each player roll a die. The player with the highest score begins. Each player set at the beginning of the game a token on one side of a cube on the board\r\n\r\n**Step 1:**\r\nPlayer decide if he will use a random cube or a special cube of the player which he bought in an earlier round of the game.\r\n\r\n**Step 2:**\r\nRoll the cube\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**\r\nThe rolled cube changes its property and shows a number of pips which the player can move his token in one and only one direction per turn.\r\n\r\n**Step 4:**\r\nSelect a possible place (green cubes) for adding the cube there.\r\n\r\n**Step 5:**\r\nSelect a the direction (a side) in which you want to move.\r\n\r\n**Step 6:**\r\nThe token moves to in the given direction and collect all mini golden cubes on its way to the destination face of a cube.\r\n\r\n**Step 7:**\r\nArrived at the destination side of a cube trigger the event of side if it has one.\r\n\r\n**Step 8:**\r\nYou can now buy special cubes with your collected mini golden cubes if you want\r\n\r\n**Step 9:**\r\nnext player\r\n\r\n###Controller\r\nUse keys **Q/Y** to move in the z-axis (back/forth)\r\n\r\nUse keys **w/s** to move in the y-axis (up/down)\r\n\r\nUse keys **a/d** to move in the x-axis (left/right)\r\n\r\nUse keys **1/2** to switch between the selection modes (CubeSelectionMode/SideSelectionMode)\r\n\r\nUse key **SPACE** to add a cube at the current position\r\n\r\n(The controller is designed for a QWERTZ-keyboard)\r\n\r\n###Used libraries\r\n[The lightweight java game library (LWJGL)](http://www.lwjgl.org/)\r\n\r\n###What I want to say...\r\nThe last few weeks were very interesting, I had a lot of fun and sometimes they have really challenged me. I learned something about graphic programming and how you should do things or not.\r\nThis project is far away from completeness yet! At the moment it's \"only\" possible to add new cubes at the possible places and remove cubes. You can also select a cube or a side of a cube and move. Switching between CUBESelectionMode and SIDESelectionMode is also possible.\r\nI know, my code is a real mess but it does what it should do.","google":""}
