### Goal
Collect as many golden mini cubes as you can during the game. You can buy special cubes with special powers with this mini cubes during the game, but is it worth it? It's up to you! Maybe you can use a special cube for your own advantage to get even more mini golden cubes or to block, prevent or harm an opponent!

###What I want to say...
The last few weeks were very interesting, I had a lot of fun and sometimes they have really challenged me. I learned something about graphic programming and how you should do things or not.
This project is far away from completeness yet! At the moment it's "only" possible to add new cubes at the possible places and remove cubes. You can also select a cube or a side of a cube and move. Switching between CUBESelectionMode and SIDESelectionMode is also possible.
I know, my code is a real mess but it does what it should do.
